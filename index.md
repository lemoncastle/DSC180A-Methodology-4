# Method 4

1. Your name and UCSD email address, formatted however you’d like.
    - Adams Yang ady005@ucsd.edu

2. The name of your section and your mentor, formatted however you’d like.
    - B05 - Deep Learning for Climate Model Emulation, Duncan Watson-Parris 

4. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
    - Learning about how climate forcings like CO2, SO2, Black Carbon etc.. can be used to model changes in climate. The paper we are working with deals with how given these forcings can we predict climate using different machine learning models. That's pretty cool!

5. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
    - In section, we talked about how if there was a correlation between human migration and changes in climate. However we concluded there may be too many variables involved and not enough data to accurately say it's related to climate. This is probably more of a geopolitical thing than a climate related issue. While talking with my friend we were discussing how bird migration can be related to climate change. We can use satellite data to see migration patterns of birds. We were also discussing famine and climate related issues. We were also thinking of localizing the issue to something like citrus farming in Riverside and climate.  

6. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
    - Something I'd like to change in the quarter 1 project is more communcation and asking the mentor for help more. We are only meeting once a week and the time we have to meet is getting less and less, so is the time to ask for help and clarifying questions. They are very helpful though!

7. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
    - Some technique I would interested in using in my project is learning a bit about satellite data and how that type of data works. We are working with surface air temperature data and precipiation and they can be mapped to global maps so maybe using satellite imagery and data could be useful for our next project.
